            <p>One of the reasons why reading is the best hobby is because it expands your horizons. It gives you something new and different to enjoy. ... You can learn practically anything from reading a good book on the subject. Even if you choose to read fiction, you may learn something that is helpful in your life.If you're reading to learn something or to try and find information when you work better using other medium, then yes, it is a waste of time. ... Reading is entertainment I enjoy most so when I spend about 10% of my day doing it, I don't feel like I am wasting my time.</p>
